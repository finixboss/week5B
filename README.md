# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to automate the selection of a baseline model based on multiple data versions. By evaluating model performance metrics, this project will identify the best-performing model according to the F1-score, generate a summarized report, and include the confusion matrix for visualization. This approach prepares the project for deployment to production or cloud services.
